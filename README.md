# Fake_Job_Prediction
This is a model to predict the fake job post.Dataset is job_train.csv.  
In this model, TfidVectorizer, SGDClassifier, and GridSearchCV were implemented to turn the words into vectors. Then useing SGDClassifier trains this model with GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.  
Please run the project.py to get the result.
